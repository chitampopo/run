Normally, this is what customers would cut and paste into the db.cache file
extension of a DNS server. But even a minimal one for one internal root server
would need at least two lines for an NS record and an A record.

2. However, DNS Views can have a view-specific db.cache. To see this, go into the
VitalQIP GUI and click DNS -- Zones -- Add -- Add DNS View. Enter a name such as
"Internal" and a Match-Clients list such as 10.0.0.0/8. At the bottom, set "Create
db.cache" to True. Cut and paste the Internet named.root to the db.cache File
Extension. Save.

See that the text is compressed into just one line and incomplete.

3. Do DNS Generation preview. The internal/db.cache is incorrect.

Work-around: put a $INCLUDE statement into the db.cache file extension of the View:
a. Click DNS -- Managed Files (for 8.0; Infrastructure- Managed files in 8.1)
b. Click Add -- Add Managed File. Give a name such as "named.root". Cut and paste
the contents. Save. Associate this with the same DNS server that is a assiged to a
zone under the DNS View. Save.
c. Go back to the DNS View Profile. In the db.cache file extension, put the line
$INCLUDE /opt/qip/named/managedFiles/named.root (or whatever the correct full path
is). Save.
d. When DNS Generation is done, the db.cache will be generated with the $INCLUDE
statement, and when DNS reloads it, it will read in the correct data from the
managed file.

Note: Customer reported the issue in 8.0PR3; I reproduced it in both 8.0PR4 and
8.1.
